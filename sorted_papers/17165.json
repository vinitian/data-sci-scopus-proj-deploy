        "Fate and Bioavailability of Engineered Nanoparticles in Soils: A Review,Interactions within natural soils have often been neglectedwhen assessing fate and bioavailability of engineered nanomaterials (ENM) in soils. This review combines patchwise ENM research using natural soils with the much wider literature on ENM performed in standard tests or on the fate of colloids in soils, and an analysis of the diverse ENM characteristics determining availability from the soil organisms' perspective to assess the main soil characteristics that determine the fate, speciation, and ultimately bioavailability of ENM in natural soils. Predominantly salinity, texture, pH, concentration, and nature of mobile organic compounds and degree of saturation determine ENM bioavailability.",
